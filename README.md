**Curriculum Module**

_Created with R2023a. Compatible with R2020b and later releases._

# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach the fundamental concepts in density functional theory, show how to develop numerical solvers for orbital-free and Kohn-Sham implementations of DFT and highlight the usage of two MATLAB-based DFT toolboxes.

<a name="H_F00D98E4"></a>
## Background

You can use these live scripts to teach an introduction to density functional theory, or learn basics of DFT, an inherently computational topic. The first few live scripts review the fundamentals of single-particle quantum mechanics and highlight usage of symbolic computations. Then Hartree and Hartree-Fock variational methods are introduced and simple numerical codes are provided for calculating the ground state energy of helium atom. Next, we present the Thomas-Fermi model of an atom, introducing the key notion of the energy functional of electron density. Density functional theory and its orbital-free and Kohn-Sham implementations are covered in the later live scrips. Numerical implementations of OFDFT and KS-DFT are provided for systems with spherically symmetric ground state electron densities. 


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway, use the Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Contact Us

Hints to solutions for challenging exercises are provided after such exercises. The solutions to two exercises: one for the numerical implementation of Kohn-Sham method including orbitals with nonzero angular momentum and another for solving OFDFT as an eigen problem for effective hamiltonian, are provided as separate live scripts. Contact the [MathWorks teaching resources team](mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com) if you would like to provide feedback, or if you have a question.
